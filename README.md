Effective communication between patients and healthcare providers is fundamental to ensuring accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. However, articulating symptoms accurately can be challenging for patients, potentially leading to miscommunication and suboptimal healthcare outcomes. In this context, applying the advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) presents a promising opportunity to streamline the process of symptom description and doctor recommendation, ultimately enhancing the quality of healthcare delivery. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automate the task of doctor recommendation based on patient-provided symptom descriptions. Traditional doctor recommendation systems often rely on structured data such as medical records or user ratings, which may not capture the nuances of patient symptoms expressed in natural language. But our methodology overcomes these limitations because it adopts sophisticated NLP techniques and machine learning. Central to our approach is the fine-tuning of the DistilGPT-2 language model on a comprehensive dataset of patient-doctor conversations. This fine-tuning process enables the language model to understand and generate responses tailored to healthcare-related queries. By training on a large corpus of real-world interactions, the model learns to recognize patterns and understand the context in which symptoms are described, thus facilitating more accurate and meaningful communication between patients and healthcare providers. Then, we employ the SpaCy library for keyword extraction from the output generated by the language model. These extracted keywords serve as the foundation for identifying the most relevant doctor specialties corresponding to the patient's symptoms. Leveraging a combination of Rouge-1 and Rouge-L scores, we map these keywords to specialist descriptions, allowing us to recommend the top three specialist fields that are most closely aligned with the patient's condition. Furthermore, our approach extends beyond traditional recommendation systems by incorporating explore and exploit-based algorithms such as Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB), Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and Thompson Sampling. These algorithms are renowned for their ability to balance exploration of new options with exploitation of known information, enabling more efficient and effective doctor recommendations. By dynamically adapting to patient preferences and feedback, these algorithms ensure that patients are matched with the most suitable healthcare providers based on their unique needs and preferences
