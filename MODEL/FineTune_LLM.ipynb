      "[RESPONSE]HelloThanks for query. Based on the facts that you have posted I would state that you have developed infection of the Prostate and have been taking antibiotics and Diclofenac along with Diclofenac twice daily. You need to consult qualified Urologist for clinical and digital rectal examination and get following basic tests done to confirm the diagnosis.1) Routine urine test and semen culture to find out the organisms causing this infection and antibiotics to which they are sensitive to.2) Ultrasound Scanning of abdomen and pelvis3) Semen examination and semen culture to rule out infection of genitals. With antibiotics, most of the individuals (Ausopexa, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea etc.) will need to take appropriate antibiotics as per culture report for 4-6 weeks. Get the prescription of medicines from your family Physician. Ensure to Chat Doctor.\n",

      "[RESPONSE]Hi! Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor sharing your recent health problem of a man. There is no serious problem that I can suggest to you. 1) You have not mentioned anything about history of trauma/injury. Are you sexually active? 2) Your age, if you are sexually active then chances of infection are high as well.3) you have got a yellowish sputum due to a recent sexual intercourse with someone in your life. I suggest you to get urine tested, an ultrasound of the abdomen to look for prostate enlargement as it can be due to many reasons.4) you should get yourself examined by a Urologist and go accordingly. Hope this answers your question, Please feel free to ask for any more queries.\n",

I try to vomit but it wont come out.. After taking panadol and sleep for few hours, i still feel the same.. By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time? Earlier after i relieved myself, the spinning lessen so i am not sure whether its connected or coincidences.. Thank you doc!'"

In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.'"
